#SHIPS,,,,,
tarantula7s,SHIP,"Following the conclusion of the Second AI War, the Persean League aimed to attain a more decisive victory against smaller ship classes, and to that end developed the Tarantula. The Tarantula is a ship equipped with an aggressive propulsion system that allows it to rapidly close in on enemies by diverting power from the shields to all other aspects, including the active aspect of it's armor, it's weaponry, and most importantly it's main engine for a massive forward boost. While the Tarantula is extremely effective at pursuing and killing smaller ships, the limited range of it's weaponry, coupled with the lack of firepower compared to other ships of it's size means that it is ineffective against equally sized or larger foes.",,,
elipsion7s,SHIP,"Facing significant financial losses following the events of the Battle of Forlorn Hope, the Tri-Tachyon Corporation standardized some aspects of their fleet composition to reduce running costs. To that end, the Elipsion class destroyer was developed, possessing a modular core that allows it to assume different roles in battle, with each core type wildly changing it's battlefield performance compared to others, albeit at the cost of friendly battlefield interference resulting in lower numbers being actually deployable.",,,
hound7s,SHIP,"A largely remade variant of the original Hound, this version boasts better armor, an improved flux grid, a small hangar for Talon LPCs, and a canister flak system, turning it from a freighter which happens to have heavy weaponry, to an actual dedicated combat vessel. Hound class combat freighters are very common vessels in the Persean Sector, so much so that eventually a militarized variant was demanded, and thus created.",,,
wayfarer7s,SHIP,"A redesigned hull taking after the Wayfarer's core, focusing on greater firepower and mobility with a focus on missile weaponry. Due to the rise in aggressive activities in the sector after the instability generated by the AI wars, traders demanded more militarized Wayfarers due to their comparatively high survivability and versatility compared to other freighters.",,,
trampler7s,SHIP,"With the considerable success that the Retribution and Eradicator classes were obtaining in varied combat scenarios, a new concept was made in an attempt to merge their qualities in one ship.  Trampler class cruiser was the chosen design behind that idea design,  with an aggressive loadout, which focuses on faster repositioning, while also being able to hold points of interest against smaller classes, or even lighter cruisers. Although, it cannot secure front lines in fleet engagements, and its point defense is not enough to defend itself against heavier swarms of missiles and fighters unless it dedicates its large turret to do so.",,,
Stella_Tempestas7s,SHIP,"Among the stars, in the fringes of the Persean Sector, machinations of Tri-Tachyon Defense Systemâ€™s Remnants, resulted in assembly of a beast with unimaginable power, capable of holding the marvels of shipment military forces. The aegis of shielding, the pilum of phase cloak, makes this ship capable of enduring waves of attacks while being a menace to any enemy's subsystems and antimatter drives, exposing them to further attacks. Like a jack of all trades, master of none, just a skilled captain can properly use such abilities to show the claws of this vessel.",Unidentified Vessel,01001101 01100101 01110010 01100111 01100001 00100000 01010111 01110010 01100001 01101001 01110100 01101000,
Afflictor7s,SHIP,"A dangerous and swift phase frigate with a weapons loadout powerful enough to bring down much heavier ships. This variant had its phase coil removed, and replaced by a device, which makes the ship seemingly use entropy for protection, and acquired extra engines for a powerful plasma jets system",,,
Doom7s,SHIP,"Designed when phase technology was generally unknown and phase detectors were not a standard of every sensor package, this cruiser has lost the advantage of surprise - but retains a dangerous and flexible weapons loadout. This variant had its phase coils removed and replaced by a perilous phase attractor, which can be brutal for enemy phase ships, as well as being tricky to deal with for standard vessels, since it can pull enemies towards itself, even if they are phased.",,,
Vespa7s,SHIP,"After Brawler class frigates showed inefficiency against pirate raids using Condor and Colossus carriers with Talon LPCs, an urgent demand for anti-fighter frigates manifested, which resulted in creation of Vespa-class frigate. Combining aspects from Wasp drones in a frigate chassis, this vessel accommodates some features, that can make any carrier officer die from fear and some weaponry to take down weaker enemies. However, anything that goes past its shield generator can and will be it's demise, and maintenance of this ship can put a strain on some minor fleets.",,,
Strider7s,SHIP,"After the Second AI War, manufacturers encountered a shortage of resources required to create advanced mechanisms, there were plenty of standard materials however, most of which found their sources in massive debris fields left after the conflict. In a motion to make a good use of those resources, Tri-Tachyon executives invested in project of a heavy destroyer with simple gadgets and hybrid adapters for installing low-budget ballistic weaponry. Such efforts resulted in birth of Strider-class, a ship capable of successfully chasing down enemies with it's system's boost to the speed and weaponry rivalling that of cruisers. However, its base speed is terrible, not allowing it to escape from ambushes, and deployment of such a massive destroyer is expensive to maintain.",,,
Glider7s,SHIP,"Suiting as a cheaper alternative to the Doom-class phase cruiser, Gliders rely on powerful shields, instead of Phase Cloak, while also being capable of ambushing targets with its brand-new Anchor Snare system, which deploys traction anchors that can lock down enemy ships. Despite such capabilities, this vessel is incapable of doing manoeuvres requiring high mobility, and faster and/or heavier enemies can avoid the mines, either by getting away from them, or being strong enough to be unaffected by them.",,,
Quasar7s,SHIP,"An overhaul to the Paragon-class battleship, this vessel makes use of the Quasar Surge system, which causes the vessel to leap through great distances. Unlike its classic counterpart, this one's capabilities are focused on high-speed assaults, allowing it to catch up with quicker ships, such as Aurora-class cruisers. To realize such modifications, this vessel lost its Fortress Shield system, and the Advanced Targeting Core was incompatible with the new array of specifications, making it rely on a standard targeting unit.

With an exhaustive list of modifications, the Quasar-class battleship was determined to be a reliant fleet anchor, capable of catching up with faster ships. Unlike its counterpart, this one makes use of very high speed, while also keeping almost the same firepower as Paragon.

However, despite looking simpler mechanically, unlike the fortress shield system, that requires high amounts of energy to function. The Quasar Surge system is very dangerous to any ship that is not prepared to receive such a modification.

This vessel required a structural reinforcement, located in its center, to prevent the vessel from being smashed while being propelled by the antimatter explosion. It was also given a complete overhaul of the bridge, granting the crew extra gravitational protection against the inertia caused by the sudden speed boost caused by the system.",,,
Hercules7s,SHIP,"A reliant cargo hauler, intended to be used by larger fleets as a support vessel, as well as for transporting great amounts of cargo, just like the Atlas-class superfreighter. However, this ship requires escorts to protect it, and its insufferable low speed makes it very hard to reposition around the battlefield.

Due to the destabilization caused by battles during the 1st AI war, the number of raids against trade convoys exponentially increased. This resulted in an immediate demand for a larger support vessel that could replace some Atlas-class super-freighters, trading cargo hauling efficiency for more combat capabilities, resulting in such a colossal ship.",,,
Saltare7s,SHIP,"After a recent exponential increase in pirate raids, Tri-Tachyon surveyors saw an increasing demand for direct-counters to fast-strike frigates. A prototype beam projector was developed to accomplish this goal in mind, however due to the extensive tooling and space needed for installation, it led into the development of the Saltare-Class Frigate to house the weapon. Advertised as an incredible frigate arrestor with a strong flux grid and shield emitter. Allowing it pin down frigates and force them to engage it and its allies or deny them opportunities to strike by pushing them away from itself. However, the lack in firepower and point defense against fighters makes it a vulnerable vessel while standing alone in battle scenarios.",,,
Accoster7s,SHIP,"A technologically advanced for a low-tech destroyer, It has an experimental Gamma-Array system which allows it to punch above its weight-class, vulnerable to strike craft.

With the Invictus and its LIDAR System exceeding the expectations of enemies and allies alike, it sparked interest in the idea of creating a more modern iteration of the LIDAR system that demanded less power and yet was of equal measure if not more so.

This interest was answered by the Hegemony with the Accoster, a destroyer sized ship that featured a variation of the LIDAR Array, trading its ample fire-rate increase for a Gamma Array system centered around precision. This is used to calibrate the frontal weapons on a vessel to achieve greater impacts on critical points, due to the improved imaging provided by the Gamma sensors install onto its frame.",,,
sandshark7s,SHIP,"A more new-age design, this scavenged heavy destroyer is a formidable battlecarrier formed within the bowels of Mariaath as a cheaper alternative to command cruisers, and with its vast comm-link network systems and exotic nano-salvager core, It can fight above its own weight-class when used by a savvy captain.

Once liberated from the Hegemony by the Persean League, the Mayasuran Navy was not given much in terms of millitary aid due to its low market-value, and thus, was generally limited to shipments of destroyers and frigates together with other humanitarian aid to deal with the desertification of their planet. This was less than helpful when dealing with the intensifying pirate raids and attacks on the planet. In a bid to survive, hammerheads and autoforges were put on the block and scrapped to create some of the first Mayasuran Sandsharks. These acted as the lead destroyers for their patrols and to provide additional firepower to survive the early ages of Mariaath's newly-found independence...",,,

automated_talon7s,SHIP,"The Talon fighter has undergone a conversion into a drone, rendering it both crewless and cost-effective. Created to assist Hound (M) class frigates, it maintains its good firepower and speed, with enhanced targeting efficiency. However, these modifications have resulted in a decrease in its optimal engagement distance.",,,

Repulser7s,WEAPON,"An antiquate weapon, that fires ionized antimatter in the form of unstable projectiles, which repulse targets away with a considerable force. Due to its nature, it is almost useless against other ships, since most of the projectiles don't reach the maximum range, and the damage output is not that impressive",,,
Slagga7s,WEAPON,"Commonly known as Slagger, or ""Slagga!"" to outlaws, this weapon utilizes left out molten waste from ore refineries, putting them within heat resistant shells, that usually upon being shot, crack, spewing out slag into space, as well as onto it's target, making the hull heat up, then drastically quickly cool down, the armour becoming easier to break further.",,,
